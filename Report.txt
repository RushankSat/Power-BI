Hello I am Rushank Satardekar and I have started 1 month Power BI DAX learn task in hand.

25-11-2023
Yesterday I had Interview for Addend Analytics and they have asked me to learn Power BI with DAX language.

They have also given me Resource to learn Power BI from its a Youtube channel name "Crubal" and I have started a Playlist name "DAX Friday".

#1 Its about writing a simple DAX measure in Power BI.
    Measure In Power BI, measures are used to perform calculations on your data and display the results in your reports and dashboards.
    Measures are created using the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language.

    eg. Measure = CALCULATE(COUNTA(DimGeo[City ID]),
                              DimGeo[Country])="Sweden"
                              )
    COUNTA is used because City ID datatype was not  integer.

Today I have started with DAX functions with Northwind Dataset
#2 Calander() and Calanderauto()

    Calenderauto is function which generate a column with continious dates from Dataset.
    Its Returns a table with a single column named "Date" that contains a contiguous set of dates.
    The range of dates is calculated automatically based on data in the model.

    eg. dates = CALANDERAUTO()

    Calander is function with Expressions in it start date and end date.
    Its Returns a table with a single column named "Date" containing a contiguous set of dates.
    The range of dates is from the specified start date to the specified end date, inclusive of those two dates.

    eg. dates = Calaculate(12/01/2011,12/02/2011)

    We can make a table with many columns like weekdays,yearQty...etc.

    eg. DimDate = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDAR(
        DATE(YEAR(MIN(Orders[OrderDate])), 1, 1),
        DATE(YEAR(MAX(Orders[OrderDate])), 12, 1)), "DateAsInteger", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ), "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ), "MonthNo", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ), "YearMonthNo", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/MM" ), "YearMonth", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/mmm" ), "MonthShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm" ), "MonthLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" ), "WeekNo", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ), "WeekDay", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ), "WeekDayShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ), "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ), "YearQuarter", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q" & FORMAT ( [Date],"Q" )
)

    This function can be very useful for  time-related analysis and reporting.
  #3 Sum() and Sumx()

    Sum() is function which is use to calculate total value of column.
    Its Adds all the numbers in a column.

    Syntax:- SUM(Column Name)

    eg. Total Sales = SUM(Order_Details[TotSalesColumn])

    SUMX() is function which is use to calculate each row in a table.
    Its returns the sum of an expression evaluated for each row in a table.

    Syntax:- SUMX(Table,Expression)

    eg. Total Sales X = SUMX(Order_Details,Order_Details[UnitPrice]*(1-Order_Details[Discount])*Order_Details[Quantity])

    Difference Between SUM and SUMX is that sum is Vertical count function while SUMX is Horizontal count function.
    eg. Addition of one column is done by SUM while Addition with other expression of each row in table is SUMX.

  #4 Calculated Column and Measures
  Calculated column are columns which get added to table with an operation with data.

  Calculated Column is stored with table its the new column is table.
  Measures does not consume memory and perform operation which can be use dynamically.


  In real life scenario calculated column can be created if we want another column from it.
  eg. Want to categories a sales discount5% calculated column  into high discount or low discount.

  Today I am #4 video of DAX friday series with functions

  #1 *COUNT() is function to calculate number of rows
     Its Counts the number of rows in the specified column that contain non-blank values.

     Syntx:- COUNT(Columnname)

     eg. COUNT = COUNT(Table1[ProductID])

     *COUNTA() is function to calculate number of rows but with both numerical and text values.
     Its Counts the number of rows in the specified column that contain non-blank values.

     Syntax:- COUNTA(columnname)

     eg. COUNTA = COUNTA(Table1[ProductName])

     note:- if we COUNTA a blank column it would result in "(Blanks)".
            Date is consider numerical in Power BI and excel.

     *COUNTX is function which calculate values from table.
     Its Counts the number of rows that contain a non-blank value or an expression that evaluates to a non-blank value,
     when evaluating an expression over a table.

     Syntax:- COUNTX(Table,Expressions)

     eg. COUNTX: = COUNTX(FILTER(Table1,[StockQty]>100),Table1[ProductID])

     *COUNTAX
     Its The COUNTAX function counts non-blank results when evaluating the result of an expression over a table.
     That is, it works just like the COUNTA function, but is used to iterate through the rows in a table and count rows
      where the specified expressions results in a non-blank result.

      Syntax:- COUNTAX(Table,Expressions)

      eg. COUNTAX = COUNTAX(FILTER(Table1,[StockQty]>100),Table1[ProductName])

      *DISTINCTCOUNT() is function which show distinct values from Columns.
      Its Counts the number of distinct values in a column.

      Syntax: - DISTINCTCOUNT(Column)

      *DISTINCTCOUNT with Expression
      Its function to filter value from Table

      eg. DISTINCTCOUNTwEXP = COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(Table1[StockLocation]))


      *COUNTBLANK is function which count blank rows.
      Its Counts the number of blank cells in a column.

      Syntax:- COUNTBLANK(column)

      eg. COUNTBLANK = COUNTBLANK(Table1[StockLocation])

      *COUNTROWS() is function to calculate rows in table.
      Its The COUNTROWS function counts the number of rows in the specified table, or in a table defined by an expression.

      Syntax: - COUNTROWS([<table>])

      eg. COUNTROWS = COUNTROWS(Table1)

      *COUNTROWS with Expressions function is use to modify the table before performing count operation on table.

      Syntax: - COUNTROWS([<table>])

      eg. COUNTROWSwEXP = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Table1,Table1[StockLocation]="EMEA")).

      Note:- COUNTROWS function does not support columns.


    #2
      *CALCULATE() its a function that uses to calculate different expression with filters.
      Its Evaluates an expression in a modified filter context.

      Syntax:- CALCULATE(<expression>[, <filter1> [, <filter2> [, â€¦]]])

      eg. CAL TotSales = CALCULATE([SUM TotSales])


      *FILTER() is a function which filter the table with condition

      Note:- FILTER in calculate work as only value which is required but when new filter are add it start giving important to new filter.

      eg. CAL w FILTER TotSales = CALCULATE([SUM TotSales],Products[ProductName]="Queso Cabrales")
